# [DTU-R3: Remote Reality Robot](https://dtu-r3.github.io/)

## Introduction
We focus on affordable mobile robots that can navigate semi-autonomously indoors, sometimes outdoors,
and that are able to carry at least a webcam or a 360° camera, among other sensors.

A significant part is the simulation of those robots as well as interactions within the [Unity 3D engine](https://unity3d.com/).

To ensure reproducibility and to widen the possible use-cases, we implement the same approaches on several robots,
ranging from some off-the-shelf toys to developer-oriented robotic platforms, and to retrofitted wheel-chairs.

## Vision
Faciliate multi-disciplinary research & development around mobile robots,
and provide a shared platform for people not necessarility skilled in robotics
to experiment with innovative concepts in the direction of “robots as a service”.

## Intention
The project originate from the [DTU “Technical University of Denmark”](http://www.dtu.dk/english/),
[Department of Management Engineering](http://www.man.dtu.dk/english),
and its purpose is to promote collaboration between the different groups interested in
the various facets of working with such mobile robots, also from other institutes, universities, and countries.

Indeed, when starting this initiative in September 2017, we saw that there was room for improvement to better work together,
build upon each-other achievements, and thus pushing forward the quality of student and research projects,
instead of too often restarting from scratch.

This is done by lowering the bar to get started with mobile robots,
and providing more features out-of-the-box,
for student project, research projects, or even prototypes towards products.
We are also very much price-concious, as this is a key to adoption.

Thanks to a lot of existing, open-source work out there, we mainly pick, test, adapt, and document available components.
In particular, we build upon [ROS “Robot Operating System”](http://www.ros.org/), and its large ecosystem.

For similar reasons, we have picked the Unity 3D engine for our simulations and interactions needs,
since it is the most widely used 3D engine worldwide, and is therefore well-known by most people working with 3D,
including students not familiar with robotics.

Finally, since robotic projects are complex, a focus is set on standardisation, modularisation, documentation,
and other good practices.
